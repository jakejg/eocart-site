If you‚Äôre looking for a particular store, let us know and we‚Äôll get them on board! Just click the contact us button in the bottom right of the screen, or write to us at <a href=\"mailto:hello@ecocart.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hello@ecocart.io</a>.</p>\n<h4>How does EcoCart work with ad blockers</h4>\n<p>To make sure you earn your EcoPoints, we need to validate your purchase by communicating with the store where you made your transaction. Certain ad blocker settings prevent us from doing so.</p>\n<p>If you‚Äôre finding trouble using EcoCart alongside your ad blocker, simply disable your ad blocker while you shop and re-enable it once you‚Äôre finished.</p>\n"}}
