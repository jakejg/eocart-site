The term “you” or “User” refers to a Visitor or a Member. The term “we” or “our” refers to EcoCart. You may not use the Service and you may not accept this Agreement if you are not of a legal age to form a binding contract with EcoCart. If you accept this Agreement, you represent that you have the capacity to be bound by it or if you are acting on behalf of a company or entity that you have the authority to bind such entity. If you do not agree to this Agreement, please don’t use the Service.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We really want to make sure you read this next part so we’re going to use all-caps: THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS (1) AN ARBITRATION PROVISION; (2) A WAIVER OF RIGHTS TO BRING A CLASS ACTION AGAINST US; AND (3) A RELEASE BY YOU OF ALL CLAIMS FOR DAMAGE AGAINST US THAT MAY ARISE OUT OF YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE. BY USING THE SERVICE, YOU AFFIRM THAT YOU AGREE TO THESE PROVISIONS.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Privacy and your Personal Information</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For information about EcoCart’s privacy and data protection practices, please read EcoCart’s Privacy Policy found at www.EcoCart.io/privacy. Our privacy policy explains how EcoCart collects, uses and shares your information that you provide when you access the Service. By using the Service, you consent to EcoCart’s collection, use, and sharing of your information as set forth in our privacy policy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Description of the Service</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As part of the Service, we provide you with a suite of tools that allows Users to locate and obtain deals, coupons, exclusive offers, pricing information, product, and other information to help make informed purchase decisions at attractive prices. The Service also includes our EcoPoints and any other offerings described below.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Service is provided to you by EcoCart as a free service. We work on your behalf with the aim of locating the best publicly available offers and negotiating exclusive offers that are better than any publicly available deal. We make money to sustain the service when you purchase or engage with these offers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Account Information from Third Party Sites</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the Service, Members may direct EcoCart to interact with existing accounts they own and that are maintained online by third-party companies with which they have accounts (“Third Party Accounts”) such as Facebook or their accounts on the websites of specific merchants. EcoCart makes no effort to review the Third Party Accounts for any purpose, including but not limited to accuracy, legality or non- infringement. EcoCart is not responsible for the products and services offered by or on third-party sites. If your permission settings allow it, EcoCart may import information from your Third Party Accounts to help better offer the Services to you. EcoCart does not control the policies and practices of any third-party site or service, including any Third Party Accounts you connect to the Services.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">EcoCart cannot always foresee or anticipate technical or other difficulties which may result in failure to obtain data or loss of data, personalization settings or other service interruptions. EcoCart cannot assume responsibility for the timeliness, accuracy, deletion, non-delivery or failure to store any user data, communications or personalization settings.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">EcoCart Offers and Third-Party Links</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some parts of the Service are supported by sponsored links from third-party advertisers and the display of “EcoCart Offers,” which are product offers sponsored by third-parties that may be (subject to and in accordance with our privacy policy) custom matched to you based on information stored in the Service, queries made through the Service or other information. We sometimes use specially formatted links for which we receive a commission on resulting sales or clicks from affiliate partners (“Affiliate Links”).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you click on a sponsored advertiser link, EcoCart Offer or Affiliate Link, you will be redirected to the site, of the third-party which offers the products (or a specific portion of the Services dedicated for the partner’s offerings, from which the third-party’s website will be accessible), and (subject to and in accordance with our privacy policy) your session may be tracked using cookies.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In connection with EcoCart Offers, the Service will provide links to other websites belonging to EcoCart advertisers and other third parties. EcoCart does not endorse, warrant or guarantee the products or services available through the sponsored advertiser link, EcoCart Offer or Affiliate Link, (or any other third -party products or services advertised, presented on or linked from any portion of our Services), whether or not sponsored. EcoCart is not an agent, distributor, re-seller, broker or otherwise responsible for such third-parties or the activities or policies of those websites or the products or services. available on them. EcoCart does not promise or guarantee that the product details, prices, coupon availability or other service terms, rates or rewards offered by any particular advertiser or other third-party via our Service are the best prices, terms or lowest rates available in the market.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you access third-party websites via our Service, you accept that there are risks in doing so, and that EcoCart is not responsible for such risks. We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Service and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each third-party website or service that you visit or utilize.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">EcoCart has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, accuracy, privacy policies, or practices of or opinions expressed in any third-party websites or by any third-party that you interact with through the Services. In addition, EcoCart will not and cannot monitor, verify, censor or edit the content of any third-party site or service. By using the Services, you release and hold us harmless from any and all liability arising from your use of any third-party website or service.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If there is a dispute between participants on our Service, or between users and any third-party, you agree that EcoCart is under no obligation to become involved. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in the event that you have a dispute with one or more other users, you release EcoCart, its officers, employees, agents, and successors from claims, demands, and damages of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such disputes and/or our Services. If you are a California resident, you shall and hereby do waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: ”A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH, IF KNOWN BY HIM MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">EcoPoints</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where you carry out certain activities via our Service (including clicking on certain EcoCart Offers) you will earn rewards points that we call “EcoPoints”. EcoPoints are awarded where you complete a certain action using the Service, most commonly by completing a transaction on a specific third-party merchant’s website. Where EcoPoints are applicable to a particular action, this will be indicated on the Service. Once you accumulate enough EcoPoints, you can log in and redeem it for a gift card on the EcoCart extension. Selection of merchant gift cards may vary based on program availability. Use of a third-party merchant gift card at a selected merchant will be subject to the merchant’s own terms of service.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We can afford to give you EcoPoints because these offers are designed to share with you a portion of an affiliate commission paid by a third-party merchant to us. As such we can only provide EcoPoints to you when an action is successfully completed and tracked and after we are paid the relevant commission by the third-party merchant. If we are ultimately unable to recover payment from the relevant third-party merchant, then EcoCart shall have no obligation to provide any EcoPoints to you for the action performed by you. This includes instances where there are difficulties in tracking a transaction due to your use of an ad blocker or interaction with another affiliate program. To ensure you are eligible for EcoPoints in relation to a transaction, we may require you to provide copies of your order confirmation, order number, or other proof of purchase. Additionally, you must be a Member in order to participate in the EcoPoints program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have any trouble using EcoPoints then please contact us at </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">support@ecocart.io</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and we will try to figure out what went wrong. In our sole discretion we may choose to award you EcoPoints if you provide enough information about your transaction. Please note that to prevent abuse your account may become ineligible for EcoPoints if tracking your transactions becomes an issue. Basically, we’re going to try to be good people and we hope you choose to do the same. This only works if everyone plays fairly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">EcoPoints are not transferable (i.e. it is personal to each User) and can expire as further explained below.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Expiration of EcoPoints</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To maintain your EcoPoints points, you must earn at least 10 EcoPoints points during each consecutive 12-month period. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, if you do not earn at least 10 new EcoPoints in each 12-month period, your EcoPoints balance will automatically reset to zero (0). To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you agree that any disputes about whether your EcoPoints points should expire will be resolved by EcoCart in its sole discretion, and you agree to abide by EcoCart’s resolution of such dispute.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Referral And Other Rewards Programs</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Periodically EcoCart may make you offers to receive EcoPoints or other rewards for taking actions to promote the Service, such as referring a friend (collectively “Rewards Programs”). In general, if you participate within the spirit of the program you will be rewarded. However, to protect ourselves from seen and unforeseen issues we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to withhold such consideration, including EcoPoints, for any reason at any time with or without any cause. By participating in EcoCart Rewards Programs you accept this condition. Additionally, we may choose in our sole discretion to institute a limit on how many times you can receive each type of reward. These limits will vary from program to program. If you have questions about how many times you can participate in each Rewards Program please contact us.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">EcoCart reserves the right to withhold or retract EcoPoints if it was accumulated through deceptive, artificial, or illegal means designed to cheat or game the program. (For instance, if you try to accumulate EcoPoints through use of a bot network, purchased email lists for unconsented referrals, or by engaging in repeated purchase-return behavior.)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In association with Rewards Programs you may be issued personalized links that (subject to and in accordance with our privacy policy) track traffic back to your account so that we can issue you rewards. You agree not to promote these personalized links through any unapproved channels which include but are not limited to: unsolicited email (SPAM), search advertising, display advertising, or any paid promotional channel. If you have questions about a specific promotional method please contact us for permission BEFORE you begin promoting your personalized link. Failure to do so will result in all rewards being withheld and your account potentially being suspended.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">EcoCart reserves the right at any time to cancel, modify, or restrict any aspect of our Rewards Programs, including any point conversion ratios, redemption offers, expiration terms, etc. EcoCart reserves the right to apply such changes retroactively to rewards already accrued under any Rewards Program, if it determines that you have done so in violation of this Agreement.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your Registration Information</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You agree and understand that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password which, together with your Login ID email address, allows you to access the Service. That Login ID and password, together with any other contact information you provide form your “Registration Information.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By providing us with your email address, you agree to receive all required notices electronically, to that e-mail address.

We may also use your email address to contact you about our own and third-parties’ goods and services that may be of interest to you. If you do not want us to use your information in this way, please check the relevant box located on the form on which we collect your data, adjust your user preferences in your account profile and /or click “Unsubscribe” in any e-mail communications we send you.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you become aware of any unauthorized use of your Registration Information, you agree to notify EcoCart immediately.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your Use of the Service</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your right to access and use the Service is personal to you and is not transferable by you to any other person or entity.

In order for the Service to function effectively, you must also keep your Registration Information up to date and accurate. If you do not do this, the accuracy and effectiveness of the Service to you will be affected.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your access and use of the Service may be interrupted from time to time due to third-party failures outside of our control (such as unavailability of general Internet infrastructure). Access and use may also be interrupted for periodic updating, maintenance or repair of the Service by EcoCart. While we will make reasonable efforts to make the Service available to you, we do not promise that it will be available at all times.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You agree that EcoCart may use your feedback, suggestions, or ideas in any way, including in future modifications of the Service, other products or services, advertising or marketing materials (although any use of your personal information will be subject to our privacy policy).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As is further detailed in our privacy policy, EcoCart collects information about the websites that you visit in order to create a better user experience for you and other EcoCart users. Examples of this type of information include information about the products your browser visits, including the current product prices and other product details. Please consult our privacy policy for further information. In the future (and always subject to our privacy policy), we may offer personalization options in our products that utilize knowledge about what products you are interested in to present relevant content and product offers.

Our basic operating point of view is to do everything we possibly can to avoid annoying you so wherever possible we will minimize unnecessary notifications and provide configuration switches to limit unwanted communications.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Automatic notifications may be sent to you following certain changes made online to your EcoCart account, such as a change in your Registration Information.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Voluntary account notifications may be turned on by default as part of the Service. They may then be customized, deactivated or reactivated by you. These notifications allow you to choose alert messages for your accounts. EcoCart may add new notifications from time to time, or cease to provide certain notifications at any time upon its sole discretion. Each alert has different options available, and you may be asked to select from among these options upon activation of your notifications service.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Electronic notifications will be sent to the email address you have provided as your primary email address for the Service. If your email address changes, you are responsible for informing us of that change. Changes to your email address will apply to all of your notifications.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because notifications are not encrypted, we will never include your passcode. However, notifications may include your EcoCart login information and some information about your accounts. Anyone with access to your email will be able to view the content of these notifications. At any time you may disable certain notifications, although we may still send you Service-related notices as needed to allow us to provide you the Service.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rights you Grant to us</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By submitting information, data, passwords, usernames, PINs, other log-in information, materials and other content to EcoCart through the Service, then (except for User Content, to which the specific rules below apply) you hereby give EcoCart permission to use that content solely for the purpose of providing the Service. EcoCart may use and store the content, but only to provide the Service to you. By submitting this content to EcoCart, you represent that you are entitled to submit it to EcoCart for use for this purpose, without any obligation by EcoCart to pay any fees or other limitations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">EcoCart’s Intellectual Property Rights</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The contents of the Service, including its “look and feel” (e.g., text, graphics, images, logos and button icons), photographs, editorial content, notices, software (including html-based computer programs) and other material are protected under copyright, trademark and other laws.

EcoCart reserves the right to purchase carbon offsets from a different project than advertised. A reason for this could be if the specific project solicited is fully subscribed and funded at the time of carbon offset purchase, but the EcoCart extension and website does not reflect that. Shipping and production emissions are strictly estimates based on publicly available research and information. Items without available research are calculated based on EcoCart’s best estimate of the item’s materials and weight. All emissions calculations are subject to change at any time for any reason at the discretion of the EcoCart team.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Disclaimer of Representations and Warranties</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO INCLUDE A SECTION THAT IS IN ALL CAPS TO GET YOUR ATTENTION SO HERE IT GOES:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE CONTENT AND ALL SERVICES AND PRODUCTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SERVICE OR PROVIDED THROUGH THE SERVICE (WHETHER OR NOT SPONSORED) ARE PROVIDED TO YOU ON AN “AS-IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS.
