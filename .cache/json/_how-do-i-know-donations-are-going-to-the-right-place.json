Carbon offsets let you pay to reduce the global GHG total instead of making radical or impossible reductions of your own.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But not all carbon offset projects are created equal. EcoCart’s projects go through rigorous carbon offset laboratory and field testing. We only fund projects that are carefully vetted, ethically proven, and scientifically verified according to the world’s major carbon standards. Our projects are also third-party verified with site visits by our trusted partners to ensure successful calculation of greenhouse gas reductions and management of funds. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These projects issue credits, measured in metric tons (tonnes) of carbon dioxide equivalents (mtCO₂e). EcoCart evaluates the implementation of each project’s methodology and confirms that the project uses at least 90% of the proceeds from their offsets for growth and not profit.</span></p>\n"}}
