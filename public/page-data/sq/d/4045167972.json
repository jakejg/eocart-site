We built this browser extension for you to play a role in our fight against climate change. We built this browser extension because we, as consumers, wanted this to exist in the world.

We do this by partnering with brands and merchants so that whenever you use EcoCart while shopping with them, we earn a small commission, then buy carbon offsets on your behalf. We also pass along a portion of the commission to you in the form of EcoPoints, which you can use to redeem Earth-saving rewards such as planting trees or clean water to families in need. Or you can use your EcoPoints just like cash and redeem them for gift cards to your favorite stores.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The rest of the commission we keep for salaries for our team, server costs, and just to keep the lights on.
