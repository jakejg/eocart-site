The foregoing time period shall not operate to extend any applicable statute of limitations on such claim. Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights or provisions. We do not guarantee that we will take action against all breaches of these Terms. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. Except as expressly provided otherwise herein, these Terms, as modified from time to time, constitute the entire agreement between you and EcoCart regarding the Service and supersede and replace any prior agreements, understandings, representations or communications, written or oral, between you and EcoCart regarding the Service, including any prior version of these Terms. These Terms are not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by you, except with our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms, in whole or in part, at any time, in our sole discretion, without your consent. No agency, partnership, joint venture, employer-employee or franchisor-franchisee relationship is intended or created by these Terms.

All amended terms shall automatically be effective after they are initially posted on the Service. If a revision is material, we may provide notice of such revision 30 days prior to any new terms taking effect; provided, however, that what constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion. These Terms may not be otherwise amended except in a writing signed by you and an authorized representative of EcoCart.</p>\n<p>Please review these Terms from time to time to ensure that you are aware of any changes. You are responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar with any modifications to these Terms.

If the specific project solicited is fully subscribed and funded at the time of carbon offset purchase, but the EcoCart plugin and website does not reflect that, EcoCart will buy carbon offsets on behalf of the customer for a project with a similar cost and environmental impact-profile based on the discretion of the EcoCart team. Shipping and production emissions are strictly estimates based on publicly available research and information. Items without available research are calculated based on EcoCart’s best estimate of the item’s materials and weight. All emissions calculations are subject to change.</p>\n<p><b style=\"color: #00b050;\">Agreement to Terms<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></b></p>\n<p>By creating an EcoCart account, installing our Shopify App, and/or utilizing our services, you hereby indicate that have read and agree to these Terms of Service and the Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p><b style=\"color: #00b050;\">Contact Us</b></p>\n<p>If you have any questions about these Terms, please contact us at <a style=\"color: #00b050;\" href=\"mailto:support@ecocart.io\">support@ecocart.io</a></p>\n"}}}}
