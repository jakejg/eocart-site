It also describes our practices for collecting, using, protecting and disclosing that information.</p>\r\n<p>This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect on the Website or through the Software, including information about you that is provided to us by our B2B Customers when you use the Software on such customers’ websites. It does not apply to information collected by us offline or through any other means, including information collected on any other website operated by EcoCart, its affiliates or any third party. It also does not apply to any other information collected by a third party (including our affiliates) through any means, including information collected through any application or content (other than the Software) that may link to or be accessible from or on the Website.</p>\r\n<p>Please read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your information and how we will treat it.
